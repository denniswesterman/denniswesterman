# Hi, I'm Dennis Westerman! ðŸ‘‹

My passion is to share knowledge with the world and help others learn and grow. Software development is my core focus, and I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and building a supportive community. A personal blog is in the works, where experiences and insights will be shared in an accessible, friendly way.

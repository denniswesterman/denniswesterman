# Hi, I'm Dennis Westerman! ðŸ‘‹

Technology is about **people** first. That's what drives me as a **Lead ICT Architect**, software developer, and enthusiastic open-source advocate. My mission? Creating innovative workplaces where technology connects teams, sparks creativity, and empowers everyone to perform at their bestâ€”without barriers.

I believe IT should be seamless, secure, and adaptable, enabling collaboration rather than complicating it. Want to explore more about this vision? Dive into my detailed [Workplace Vision & Strategy](workplace/readme.md).
